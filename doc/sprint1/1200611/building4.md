# Building 4

A full wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) coverage is required for both floors of this building.

To ensure the coverage of the building its taken into consideration that its needed 2 outlets per each 10 m2.

## Ground Floor
The ground floor has an underfloor cable raceway connected to the external technical ditch.

The ceiling height on this floor
is 4 meters.

Room 4.0.5 used to house an intermidiate and a horizontal cross-connect because of being a storage room and being closer to the ceeling cable passageway and the underground raceway , there no outlets required in there as well as in the restroom and common areas like the entrance hall.

The HC and IC are placed the same room, and in the same closet to reduce the spaced ocuppied within the room and the length of fiber optic cable type monomode needed.

Taking in considereation that a AP has a range of 50m in diameter it was placed in room 4.0.2 because of its central location to cover the whole floor.
