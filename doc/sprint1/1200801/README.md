===========================================
## Building 5:

## Ground Floor:

Room 5.0.2 is considered a storage area so there is no need to put any type of outlet there, as well as the restrooms, the entrance hall, and other common areas and it's where I decided to place the IC in because it is closer to the celling cable passageway and to the entrance, giving the possibility to access the next floor reducing the need for fiber optic cable.

The HC was placed next to the IC with the same purpose.

Since the entire space must have access to wi-fi, 1 AP was placed at the beginning of room 5.0.3, because it's the best position to cover the entire floor, considering its range.

The HC and the IC were placed in the same closet to reduce the space needed in the room to contain them.

Taking into account that the rule of at least 2 outlets per 10 m2 is followed:
